# 📅 WEEK 1 — Node.js Runtime & Event Loop (Deep)

This week is about **how Node breathes**.

## Topics 1

- Node.js runtime vs browser JS
- Call stack, heap
- Event loop phases (timers, I/O, check, close)
- Microtasks vs macrotasks
- `process.nextTick` vs `Promise`
- Blocking vs non-blocking code

## Practice (non-negotiable) 1

- Write code that **logs execution order**
- Break the event loop _on purpose_
- Compare sync vs async CPU tasks

## Output 1

- A **markdown doc** explaining the event loop _in your own words_
- Small scripts demonstrating each phase

🧠 **Senior signal**: You can predict execution order _before_ running code.
